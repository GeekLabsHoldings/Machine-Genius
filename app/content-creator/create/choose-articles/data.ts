        "A consumer group is urgently calling on the federal government to follow other jurisdictions in the U.S and Europe and bring in legislation to stem the slide toward a cashless society.",
        "Only 10 per cent of transactions in Canada today are done using cash, according to Carlos Castiblanco, an economist with the group Option Consommateurs.",
        '"There is a need to protect cash right now before more merchants start refusing [it]," Castiblanco recently told CBC Radio\'s Ontario Today.',
        "It's critical to act now, he added, before retailers begin removing all of the infrastructure required to store and maintain physical money.",
        '"They are already used to dealing with cash," he said. "So this is the moment to act, before it is more complicated."',
        'In a report called "Will cash be a thing of the past?", Option Consommateurs published one of the first deep dives into who is still using coins and paper money.',
        "A recent online poll of some 1,500 people commissioned by a different group, Payments Canada, found that a majority of respondents were worried about the prospect of cashless stores and want to maintain the option to use cash — which is free from bank fees, isn't susceptible to privacy breaches and can be used during internet outages.",
        '"There\'s still very solid demand for cash," Sharon Kozicki, the deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in a recent interview with CBC.',
        "The bank closely tracks how money gets used, she said, with the use of cash actually rising at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        'While that growth has slowed, Kozicki said there\'s still an "overall general increase that suggests people still want it."',
        "Even a report commissioned by the Bank of Canada suggests it's time to protect access to money.",
        'That report, titled "Social policy implications for a less-cash society," recommends legislative action, arguing that cash-based transactions have plummeted from 54 per cent in 2009 to 10 per cent as of 2021.',
        "One of its authors, Aftab Ahmed, described who would be most affected by a world with no cash in a recent article in Policy Options, the online magazine for the Institute for Research on Public Policy.",
        '"For many — such as Indigenous peoples, unhoused individuals, older Canadians, victims of domestic abuse and others who are vulnerable — cash is a beacon of economic security, a source of financial autonomy, an emergency lifeline and an emblem of cultural traditions," Ahmed wrote.',
        '"Canada must avoid sleepwalking into a cashless future and instead recognize the risk of exacerbating financial exclusion of those most vulnerable."',
        "The issue has caught fire outside Canada, Castiblanco said, with several jurisdictions beginning to legislate to protect access to cash.",
        'In 2019, Philadelphia became the first city in North America to prohibit "a person selling or offering for sale consumer goods or services at retail from refusing to accept cash as a form of payment."',
        "Other U.S. cities, including New York, Seattle and Los Angeles, have since moved ahead on the issue.",

        "Consumer groups in the United Kingdom such as Payment Choice Alliance are pushing that country to follow Ireland's model.",
        '"I think that we need urgent action now," the alliance\'s spokesperson, Ron Delnevo, told Ontario Today.',
        "The group is calling for new rules in the U.K. by the end of 2025.",
        '"We feel if it goes beyond that, there [will be] so many businesses not accepting cash," Delnevo said. "Cash will be so difficult to access that the whole [cash-based system] will fall down."',

        "More than 100 Indigenous communities are involved in residential schools grave searches, and they had to pay to access aerial maps from libraries and obtain records through access-to-information requests with government institutions, said Kimberly Murray, independent special interlocutor for missing children in unmarked burials. ",
        "While the tool may come too late to help ongoing community searches, Murray said every new bit of data helps while looking for lost children.",
        '"The more information that is out there for communities, the better," said Murray. "But I do think that Canada hasn\'t gone far enough in what it\'s made available."',
        "Approximately 150,000 First Nations, Inuit and Métis were removed from their families during the time residential schools operated. Ottawa had used the Indian Act to force children to attend the government-funded to be indoctrinated into Euro-Christian Canadian society. ",

        "These institutions weren't included in the $1.9-billion Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement, which required the government to compile and turn over records to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission documenting the history of the institutions.",
        "Tricia Logan, interim academic director at the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia, said she hopes the map gets updated with all institutions that were used to assimilate Indigenous children. ",
        "\"Anything that's made more available  … a little bit more transparent is always so helpful and supportive to Nations and communities that are doing that research right now,\" said Logan, who's also an assistant professor in First Nations and Indigenous Studies at UBC.",
        "The map doesn't include any information about residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized to residential school survivors in that province following a $50-million settlement agreement after they were left out because the federal government did not run boarding schools in their province. ",
        "Another notable absence from the list is the former boarding school in Île-à-la-Crosse, Sask., which continues to be a source of disagreement between the federal and Saskatchewan governments over who shoulders responsibility.",
        "Despite the missing information, Logan said the data the government has made available could help counter misinformation and disinformation about residential schools, known as denialism.",

        "Young Canadians who participate in a coveted internship program on Parliament Hill say federal politics isn't anything like the version of it you see on TV.",
        "In fact, they say, it's far more civilized and less combative than video clips from question period might lead you to believe.",
        '"Before coming to Ottawa and getting to work on the Hill, question period basically defined what politics looked like to me," said Ahdithya Visweswaran, an intern from Edmonton.',
        "\"But what you don't see on the screen is the MP crossing the floor to go talk to someone, get a little scoop on — 'Hey, my constituent needs their casework looked at right away' — or another MP coming and just having a conversation with them behind the curtains.\"",
        '"MPs aren\'t just screaming at each other," he said. "They\'re working together to achieve what they want, which is a better life for all Canadians across the country."',
        "Visweswaran is one of four participants in the Parliamentary Internship Programme (PIP) who spoke with The House. They all said they were struck by the amount of co-operation and shared values they observed in Parliament.",
        '"If an everyday Canadian or a political science student is watching question period, that is incredibly different than what happens at the committee level or what happens in constituency offices," said Katie Campbell, an intern from Winnipeg. ',
        '"There are so many nuances associated with parliamentary duties and how to represent Canadians that you don\'t get to learn in a classroom," she said. Being a parliamentary intern, she added, means getting to be "on the ground of what politics actually looks like, and learn from your MP, learn from your staffers, learn from constituents as well." ',
        "The 10 to 12 people awarded spots in the program annually each spend half of their internship with an MP from the governing party and the other half with an opposition party. It's one of the few truly non-partisan initiatives on the Hill, said Paul Thomas, the program's director. ",
        '"It is really quite fascinating to me to see the interns discussing how many of the issues from their different placements are the same, whether it\'s a Conservative riding, Liberal, NDP, Bloc," said Thomas. "And also that MPs are often more willing to work together and share information than might be expected."',

        "\"I've worked for two incredible MPs, both women, different ideologies, different parties, but similar in their approach to politics, which is that 'I am an accessible person for my constituency,'\" said Despatie, who is from Ottawa. ",
        "The program, which was founded in 1970, also involves interns spending time in MPs' riding offices.",
        "Arianne Joyce Padillo, of Mississauga, Ont., said those days spent in the riding offered an eye-opening glimpse of just how many people turn to their MPs for help.",
        "\"Getting to do the riding visits and working in the constituency office for a week, you get to see there are actually people, constituents that go into those offices and say, 'Can we meet with my MP?'\" she said. \"Or, 'Hey, listen, I have this visa issue or this immigration issue.' There is a lot that they look to their MP for, regardless of whether or not they voted for them.\"",
        "The interns also got to understand how hard the job can be.",
        "\"One thing that my first MP said to me, that has really stuck with me, is, 'The day that the seven-hour drive from the riding to Ottawa becomes a chore is the day that I know that this job is no longer for me,' and that he needs to constantly remind himself that being in Ottawa is a privilege and is a duty to represent his constituents first and foremost,\" said Visweswaran.",
        "Being a member of Parliament often includes being on the receiving end of some abusive behaviour — something the interns also saw first-hand.",
        "During the first month of her placement, Padillo said she was on her own in the office during question period when her MP rose to answer a question. Shortly after, the phone rang.",
        '"The person who called was not even a constituent … but they still took the time to look up their office number in Ottawa," said Padillo. "It turned out to be a really aggressive person who was just very angry. And I said I would pass on a message, but that message was not worth passing on because it was just full of expletives and nothing valuable."',
        "Because it was her first such experience, she said, it left her a little shaken.",
        '"But then after that, I got right back to work," she said. "If it doesn\'t faze an MP, it\'s not going to faze me. And it\'s not enough to turn me away from the opportunities that are present on the Hill."',
        'Despatie said that an MP is often seen not as an individual, but as "a voice, as a person that shows up on TV."',
        '"It\'s been a good reminder for me that MPs are people and they have families and they have lives and they have responsibilities and they are juggling it all."',

        "Some police services in Canada are using facial recognition technology to help solve crimes, while other police forces say human rights and privacy concerns are holding them back from employing the powerful digital tools.",
        "It's this uneven application of the technology — and the loose rules governing its use — that has legal and AI experts calling on the federal government to set national standards.",
        '"Until there\'s a better handle on the risks involved with the use of this technology, there ought to be a moratorium or a range of prohibitions on how and where it can be used," says Kristen Thomasen, law professor at the University of British Columbia.',
        "As well, the patchwork of regulations on emerging biometric technologies has created situations in which some citizens' privacy rights are more protected than others.",
        '"I think the fact that we have different police forces taking different steps raises concerns [about] inequities and how people are treated across the country, but [it] also highlights the continuing importance of some kind of federal action to be taken," she said.',
        "Facial recognition systems are a form of biometric technology that use AI to identify people by comparing images or video of their faces — often captured by security cameras — with existing images of them in databases. The technology has been a controversial tool in police hands.",
        "In 2021, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found that RCMP violated privacy laws when they used the technology without the public's knowledge. That same year Toronto police admitted some of its officers used facial recognition software without informing their chief. In both cases the technology was supplied by U.S. company Clearview AI, whose database was composed of billions of images scraped from the internet without the consent of those whose images were used.",
        'Last month, York and Peel Police in Ontario said they had begun implementing facial recognition technology provided by multinational French company Idemia. In an interview, York PoliceConst. Kevin Nebrija said the tools "help speed up investigations and to identify suspects sooner," adding that in terms of privacy, "nothing has changed because security cameras are all around."',
        "Yet in neighbouring Quebec, Montreal Police Chief Fady Dagher says the force will not adopt such biometric identification tools without a debate on issues ranging from human rights to privacy.",
        '"It\'s going to be something that is going to take a lot of discussion before we think about putting in place," Dagher said in a recent interview.',
        'Nebrija stressed that the department consulted the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario for best practices, adding that the images police will acquire will be "obtained lawfully," either with the co-operation of security camera owners or by obtaining court orders for the images.',
        "And although York police insist officers will seek judicial authority, Kate Robertson, a senior researcher at University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, said Canadian police forces have a history of doing just the opposite.",
        'Since the revelations about Toronto police using Clearview AI between 2019 and 2020, Robertson said she is "still not aware of any police service in Canada that is obtaining prior approval from a judge to use facial recognition technology in their investigations."',
        'According to Robertson, getting the go-ahead from the court, usually in the form of a warrant, represents the "gold standard of privacy protection in criminal investigations." This ensures a facial recognition tool, when used, is appropriately balanced against the right to free expression, freedom of assembly and other rights enshrined in the Charter.',
        "While the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction over provincial and municipal police forces, it can amend the Criminal Code to incorporate legal requirements for facial recognition software in the same way it updated the law to address voice recording technologies that could be used for surveillance.",
        "In 2022, the federal, provincial and territorial heads of Canada's privacy commissions called on lawmakers to establish a legal framework for appropriate use of facial recognition technology, including empowering independent oversight bodies, prohibiting mass surveillance and limiting how long images can be retained in databases.",
        'Meanwhile, the federal Economic Development Department said Canadian law "could potentially" regulate corporate collection of personal information, under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA.',
        '"If, for example, a police force, including the RCMP, were to contract out activities that use personal information to a private company conducting commercial activities, then these activities could potentially be regulated by PIPEDA, including services related to facial recognition technologies," the department said.',
        "Quebec provincial police also have a contract with Idemia, but they wouldn't say exactly how they use the company's technology.",
        'In an emailed statement, the police said its "automated face comparison system is not used to check the identity of individuals. This tool is used for criminal investigations and is limited to the data sheets of individuals who have been fingerprinted under the Identification of Criminals Act."',
        "AI governance expert Ana Brandusescu said Ottawa and the country's police forces have not heeded the calls for better governance, transparency, and accountability in procurement of facial recognition technology.",
        '"Law enforcement is not listening to academics, civil society experts, people with lived experience, people who are directly harmed," she said.',

He said he did share an article entitled "Palestinians are Warsaw Ghetto Prisoners of Today" without comment, but added that he didn\'t agree with the article\'s claim.',
        '"I did share an article on Twitter, without comment, in 2014 for discussion as I was an academic studying such issues. I did not agree with the comparison. However, I do accept and sincerely apologize that this has deeply offended members of the Jewish community and I would never do such a thing now," he said in an email.',
        "In 2015, Dattani also spoke on a panel in the U.K. alongside a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic fundamentalist group that seeks to establish a new caliphate and opposes the existence of an Israeli state.",
        "Dattani said he was unaware of the other panelists' affiliations and had never met them before.",
        '"I challenged the views of the other panel members and I wholeheartedly disagree with and condemn Hizb ut-Tahrir," he said in his email.',

        "He was not impressed, and shared it with the Star.",
        "“The Ministry of Health is sorry to hear of the challenges you’ve faced with your wheelchair,” said the unsigned email reply from the ministry’s correspondence and corporate support unit. ",
        "“The ADP strives to provide customer-oriented support … ADP staff will take your concerns into consideration,” the reply added, providing MacDonald with a separate ADP email address to contact with any “further concerns.”",
        "MacDonald says he’d already emailed that address, and feels “very frustrated.”",
        "“That correspondence begs the question of why ADP has not seen fit to respond to my previous emails concerning the difficulties I have encountered,” he said.",
        "Jones’s office declined to comment specifically on MacDonald’s situation, although the Ministry of Health sent a separate statement saying it stands by the program and noting it has procedures for handling complaints. ",
        "But the ministry does not have statistics on complaints readily available and does not track client satisfaction.",
        "MacDonald feels like he’s hit a brick wall and filed a complaint with the office of Ontario’s ombudsman, hoping the staff there can get action. ",
        "“The chair is what I’m in most of the day. It’s essential that I’m comfortable,” said MacDonald, 66. He suffered a serious brain stem stroke in 2021 that left the retired litigation lawyer with limited use of his hands and arms.",
        "Getting the chair’s cushions and other components to fit and not cause pressure sores — the wheelchair equivalent of bedsores — is a “trial-and-error” process that can entail many appointments with a technician, he says. ",
        "“The disabled population faces numerous challenges, physically, emotionally and financially,” MacDonald wrote in a recent appeal to Jones, which he shared with the Star.",
        "“Obtaining reliable, dependable and timely service for something which is essential to their mobility and independence should not be an additional challenge.” ",
        "Frustrated and now dealing with a retired power wheelchair seating technician as a last resort, MacDonald is urging the Ford government to open the power wheelchair repair business under the ADP to competition.",
        "“There has to be a better way,” said MacDonald, who is frustrated by the continuing challenges following the stroke that “upended” his life with his wife Marie, a former senior IT executive who is now his chief caregiver.",
        "The unexpected stroke hit 18 months after he retired, putting him in hospital for weeks, and causing breathing problems that resulted in two intubations and six months on a feeding tube. ",
        "“I took care of myself. I was reasonably fit, wasn’t overweight,” he said. “I asked one of my doctors, ‘Why did this happen?’ He said, ‘You’ve lost the lottery.’”",
        "Ministry of Health officials say the wheelchair contract was assumed by a company called Motion LP — which has branches across the province selling and servicing “high technology power wheelchairs” — from Shoppers Home Health Care in 2016. ",
        "As such, the ministry funds Motion to run the “central equipment pool” or CEP, first established in 1996, for the power wheelchairs. The pool provides clients with “new and recycled” wheelchairs “at discounted prices and provides a rebate on the client’s costs once the equipment is returned.” ",
        "“Due to the cost and complexity of power dynamic positioning wheelchairs, only a few select vendors have the expertise and technology to undertake management of the CEP,” ministry spokesperson Adriana Dutkiewicz said in a statement to the Star.",
        "“The ministry receives and tracks complaints … the complaints are reviewed, investigated and resolved by the program. Any concerns related to client safety are taken extremely seriously, in accordance with the government’s agreement with Motion.”",
        "Ontario’s auditor general found eight years ago that while the contract with Shoppers was reached through a competitive bidding process, the ministry “assigned” the contract to Motion.",
        "“We noted concerns … about the quality of services provided (by Motion), including a lack of responsiveness to client inquiries,” the auditor general’s office said in a statement to the Star this week. ",
        "The company was required to submit an annual service plan to the ministry and year-end reports “to ensure the appropriate oversight,” including performance metrics, according to a follow-up report in 2020.",
        "But MacDonald’s troubles with Motion have included leaving detailed voice-mail messages but not getting return calls, a lack of promised followup from in-person appointments, delays in getting parts and a wheelchair battery, and being called in for a battery replacement that had to wait until the next day for a more experienced technician to install it.",
        "These are problems for disabled people who rely on their power wheelchairs for everything from getting around the house to getting to work or medical and physiotherapy appointments. ",
        "MacDonald and others say service provided by Motion is uneven. After his repeated complaints, the company has agreed to service MacDonald, who lives in Mississauga, from its more distant Hamilton office.",
        "Motion says it strives to provide “the best possible client experience in support of our vision to make life accessible for everyone” and notes the customization of power chairs is complicated — something MacDonald acknowledges.",
        "“Each individual has unique needs,” chief executive officer Sue Gilpin said in a statement to the Star.",
        "Gilpin said the timeline for repairs and adjustments can depend on recommendations from therapists and approvals from third-party funders, and the ordering and delivery of parts. ",
        "“We are not permitted to make changes to a client’s equipment without approval and direction from the therapist,” she added.",
        "“Given such complexities and the wide range of mobility and accessibility needs of our clients, there have been exceptional circumstances in which we did not achieve the customer service standards that we set out for our business,” she acknowledged. ",
        "“In such cases we always try to work directly with the client to understand their experience and identify any opportunities for improvement.”",
        "In MacDonald’s case, that included sending staff for extra training, as Gilpin acknowledged in a letter the retired lawyer shared with the Star.",
        "Jeff Preston, an associate professor of disability studies at King’s University College in London, Ont.,  says the monopoly on service enjoyed by Motion is a “disservice” to the disabled community.",
        "“The result has been to wipe out the service, repair and sales industry,” said Preston, who has used a wheelchair for 24 years after being born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy.",
        "“I’ve heard wildly different reports of the quality of care and quality of support that people receive from one unit to another based on where they’re living,” he said. “People are trapped as a result.”",
        "He applauded MacDonald for going public and drawing attention to the situation. ",
        "“Not everybody has the energy, the training, the ability, the passion to be able to speak up.”",
        "A leading advocate for the disabled says problems like MacDonald’s are a “recurring issue” in a way that other Ontarians might not understand.",
        "“When you take your car in for service, you can rent a car or take an Uber but you can’t do that with a wheelchair because a lot of them are customized,” says David Lepofsky of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance.",
        "Lepofsky supports MacDonald’s call to end the service monopoly. ",
        "“You want the providers to compete, to give good service. You don’t want to give anyone a monopoly over basic service.”",
        "Green MPP Aislinn Clancy (Kitchener Centre) — who has been helping Kitchener-area mother Laurie O’Brien get answers six years after her adult son, David, died while waiting for wheelchair improvements — said it’s time for a review of ADP.",
        "“We need a robust system to make sure that people are being served properly. A lot of the people I know are worried, if they speak up, are they going to get worse service.”",
        "Clancy is planning a town-hall meeting where ADP clients can air their concerns “so that we can start nipping this in the bud.”",
        "Previous examinations of the ADP by the auditor general have also focused on weak oversight of sales and claims.    ",

        "Years ago, at a Canada Day celebration on Parliament Hill, one of the marquee moments was reserved for the unveiling of a new stamp.",
        "As the crowd cheered for the giant postage stamp being displayed on centre stage, a reporter colleague turned to me and said: “Is this not the perfect Canada moment — cheering for a stamp?”",
        "Whatever one regards these days as peak patriotism, Canada Day is an occasion to reflect on national institutions — not just stamps or flags or hockey — and see how well they’re holding up in tumultuous times.",
        "With no intent to rain on the Canada Day parade, it has to be said there are some clouds on the horizon for some major Canadian institutions.",
        "Start with the Supreme Court of Canada and some extraordinary remarks earlier this month from Chief Justice Richard Wagner.",
        "“Today, we are witnessing attacks on our judges and our institutions, something that we used to only see abroad,” Wagner said at his annual news conference.",
        "Is this some type of spillover from Donald Trump’s America, where the former president has spent the better part of this year railing against the courts and the justice system? Wagner didn’t say, but he did express some frustration that elected politicians — an institution in their own right — are not helping.",
        "“Even elected officials might participate in disinformation,” he said. “We did not see this before, elected officials criticizing decisions just because one specific federal government appointed the judge in question.”",
        "Wagner also noted that this creep of politicization into the justice system comes against a backdrop of a more threatening climate for politicians, especially since the so-called “Freedom Convoy” of 2022. Even at the municipal level, such as in Gatineau, Que., we’ve seen one mayor resign because of threats and a police charge levelled this week for threatening her successor.",
        "“Verbal violence has gone up, sometimes even physical violence that we didn’t see before,” Wagner said.",
        "Speaking of that convoy, even now, two years later, you can hear people in Ottawa lament how the Canadian flag was appropriated for that occupation of the capital, flown beside those ubiquitous “F—- Trudeau” flags waving from the trucks blockading the downtown. Now, for some, the mere sight of a Canadian flag billowing from a vehicle triggers unpleasant memories of a protest with dark and even dangerous elements.",
        "On that same street, just across from the Supreme Court in fact, sits the Bank of Canada, which also fired up a flare about politicization and trust in the past month.",
        "In an interview with the CBC’s Peter Armstrong, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem candidly acknowledged that inflation and high interest rates have shaken people’s trust.",
        "“That’s one of the reasons why it’s so important to get inflation back down,” said Macklem. “We’ve taken a bit of a hit, and we’re going to have to rebuild that trust.”",
        "Like Wagner, Macklem wouldn’t be drawn into a debate over which politicians were helping in that erosion of trust, but Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has drawn some criticism for saying he would fire the governor, poking ridicule at some of the forecasts from the Bank of Canada during the pandemic.",
        "Everybody seems to be in the rebuilding-trust business these days — chief among them, Justin Trudeau and his government, reeling from a bruising parliamentary session and a stinging defeat in the Toronto—St. Paul’s byelection last week, which took a safe Liberal seat away from the red team, in no small measure because of disaffection with the prime minister.",
        "The losing Liberal candidate, Leslie Church, said in her statement that the result showed that Liberals had work to do in rebuilding trust with the voters.",
        "At least no one was contesting the result of the election, though. That particular virus does seem contained to the U.S. at the moment, where Trump and his followers refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election and will likely do the same if Republicans lose in November, no matter what.",
        "But the intense debate around foreign interference in our democracy — focus of the ongoing public inquiry by Justice Marie-Josée Hogue — has threatened to make Canadians feel a little less confident in the democratic system. None of the reports to date — from Hogue or the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians — have cast doubt on the outcome of the past couple of elections in this country. But the rolling wave of insights, including the explosive news that some parliamentarians may have been involved in foreign interference, is a shock to the system.",
        "No one likes being assigned homework to complete over the summer, but there seems to be a theme emerging in our various institutions, whether that’s the Supreme Court, the Bank of Canada and of course, the very institution at the heart of our democracy — Canada’s Parliament. Trust is shaky, and that’s where the homework comes in. Politicians and the public might want to spend some time this summer reflecting on what’s chipping away at people’s faith in some of the pillars of the country.",
        "This isn’t a plea for everyone just to be nicer to each other — politics is a competitive business and for anyone to win, someone else (or several others) have to lose.",
        "But it’s in no one’s interest to win at the expense of the very institutions that define the country. Politicizing the legal system or the Bank of Canada won’t fix what is wrong with the laws or the economy. I’ve written this before too, but politicians in some way have themselves to blame for the toxification of their working culture — they spend far too much time casting their rivals as corrupt or worse.",
        "By next Canada Day, the country will be either on the verge of a coming election campaign or maybe even emerging from one. (Predictions are perilous right now.) That gives us a year to do some hard thinking about what will shore up public faith in institutions. That trust should be bigger than a postage stamp.",

        "But AI companies maintain that using the material to train their systems doesn’t violate copyright, and say limiting its use would stymie the development of AI in Canada.",
        "The two sides are making their cases in recently published submissions to a consultation on copyright and AI being undertaken by the federal government as it considers how Canada’s copyright laws should address the emergence of generative AI systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.",
        "Generative AI can create text, images, videos and computer code based on a simple prompt, but to do that, the systems must first study vast amounts of existing content.",
        "In its submission to the government, Access Copyright argued most and potentially all large language models “are currently profiting from unauthorized use and reproduction of copyright protected works.”",
        "It’s taking place in a “black box,” according to Access Copyright, which represents writers, visual artists and publishers.",
        "“Rightsholders know it is happening, but due to the information asymmetry between themselves and AI platforms, they cannot determine who is conducting the activity, with whose works, and have no mechanism to stop it from happening.”",
        "Music Canada, which represents the country’s major record labels, said last year, a fake AI-generated song mimicking the voices of Drake and The Weeknd “made one thing abundantly clear: AI models and systems have already ingested massive amounts of proprietary datasets without authorization from the source of the data or rightsholders.”",
        "The Writers’ Guild of Canada asked the government to start with implementing basic disclosure and reporting obligations. It said developers have all the knowledge of the work that is being mined and how it’s being used, while creators have none of that information.",
        "Some organizations have signed licensing deals with AI companies. But the Canadian Authors Association said rightsholders face “immense obstacles” in licensing their content “because they are being kept in the dark as to which of their works are being used” by which companies.",
        "It asked Canada to clarify that text and data mining are subject to copyright laws.",
        "Numerous lawsuits are underway in the United States over the use of copyrighted materials by generative AI systems, including one launched this week by the world’s biggest record labels against two AI music generators.",
        "The Canadian Media Producers Association said legal cases illustrate the problem posed by a lack of transparency, citing one case in which the AI company argued the rightsholder couldn’t proceed with the infringement allegation unless they could specify the exact work used for training.",
        "“Rightsholders will also undoubtedly face similar evidentiary issues as many datasets used to train Generative AI systems are purportedly destroyed after the initial training is complete,” it said.",
        "The group said it’s an issue that “demands immediate attention” and asked the government to implement transparency requirements.",
        "But AI companies maintain the kind of transparency rightsholders are asking for isn’t realistic.",
        "Microsoft told the government training large-scale AI systems involves “vast volumes” of data, and companies shouldn’t have to keep records of that or disclose the content that is used for training.",
        "“It would not be feasible to record such information and any such requirement would inhibit AI development,” it said.",
        "The company argued it is not “copyright infringement to analyze works and learn concepts and facts.”",
        "Google said AI training is already exempted under existing copyright law, though the government should adopt an exemption to make that explicit.",
        "Google said requiring permission to use content for training purposes would expose competitively sensitive information and “would effectively block the development and use of large language models and other types of cutting-edge AI.”",
        "It also said AI developers don’t have access to accurate information about copyright status.",
        "“In fact, there is no such source of truth anywhere in the world. Thus, complying with disclosure rules may simply prove impossible from the start.”",
        "Canadian AI company Cohere said using content for training AI systems works similarly to how an individual reads books to become more informed.",
        "The company said the process doesn’t violate copyright, and argued that needs to be clear in the law. Otherwise, “Canada’s ambitions to be the home of world-leading AI companies and ecosystems” could be undermined.",
        "The Council of Canadian Innovators, which represents the Canadian tech sector, said disclosure requirements would harm smaller companies as opposed to their Big Tech rivals. It warned this would “seriously hamper the potential of Canadian companies to scale significantly.”",

That’s what I would do if I was the Prime Minister. Rally the troops. Tell us why you want it and what comes next. Put it to the members.”",

        "Eyre’s comment came as former defence minister Harjit Sajjan explained his decision to intervene on behalf of a group of around 200 Afghan Sikhs who were trapped along with thousands of others in August 2021.",
        "Sajjan said in a statement that he passed along information through “appropriate” channels that he had been given about the group’s whereabouts and that doing so was in line with government policy to help vulnerable groups on the ground in Afghanistan.",
        "Sajjan said he did not instruct the forces to prioritize this group above Canadians or Afghan interpreters, who aided Canadian soldiers during previous operations.",
        "In an interview with The Canadian Press, Eyre said the military was following “legal orders” when it made an effort to specifically help the group of Afghan Sikhs.",
        "“We follow legal direction and the groups that were listed were part of … approved groups, so we got on with it.”",
        "He added it’s not up to him to say “whether the government priority was right or wrong.”",
        "“We had the list from (Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada) and we were just getting on.”",
        "When Kabul fell to the Taliban in August 2021, Canada and its allies scrambled to evacuate their citizens, along with Afghan interpreters who had worked for Canada.",
        "Canada and other countries also sought to help members of groups they designated as at risk of persecution from the Taliban, including women leaders, human rights defenders, journalists and religious minorities.",
        "Sajjan said that in the weeks leading up to the siege, Canada expanded a partnership with the Manmeet Singh Bhullar Foundation, an Alberta-based charity that was trying to help resettle hundreds of persecuted Afghan Sikhs and Hindus.",
        "The foundation had identified more than 200 Afghan Sikhs who were in Afghanistan and wanted to leave. It provided their names to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, which was helping with the required paperwork.",
        "“I provided direction to the Canadian Armed Forces, through the appropriate chain of command, to assist the group of Afghan Sikhs who had been determined eligible for evacuation from Kabul through the process underway at IRCC,” Sajjan said in a lengthy statement.",
        "“The operational details of how and where to do this work was left to military operational commanders and tactical decision-makers on the ground.”",
        "Sajjan said as the situation in Kabul worsened the organization “reached out to me personally” telling him it was unable to connect with the military directly.",
        "“I relayed whatever information the (foundation) provided about the location and status of these Sikhs to the chain of command for it to use as it saw fit, in line with its operational plan on the ground in Afghanistan.,” Sajjan said.",
        "“I did not direct the CAF to undertake a rescue mission at a Gurdwara, or anywhere else.”",
        "“At all times, my message to the (foundation) was the same as the one CAF was delivering directly to the Afghan Sikhs through its own channels: Move toward the airport.”",
        "Sajjan said the priority was “first and foremost” to evacuate Canadians, Afghan translators and those with “significant links to Canada.”",
        "“This was our main effort,” he said. “The evacuation and resettlement of other vulnerable populations, including Sikhs, was also a government priority.”",
        "In a statement, the Manmeet Singh Bhullar Foundation says “it was made abundantly clear” the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus had to find their own way to the airport.",
        "“At no point would the Canadian Armed Forces conduct a rescue mission.”",
        "Eyre said it was chaos on the ground and the military had an “expansive list” of people it was tasked to help.",
        "“Did we have instructions to rescue, or to try and extract this Sikh group? Yes, along with a number of other groups, such as the Afghan women’s soccer team.”",
        "The minister said that ultimately the military was unable to evacuate the group but that they found help through other means.",
        "Both Sajjan and Eyre say they are very proud of what was accomplished during a tumultuous and difficult time, though a parliamentary committee in 2022 said Canada’s efforts both before and after the Taliban took over, were slow and inefficient.",
        "Canada evacuated some 3,700 people from Afghanistan.",
        "The foundation, along with the World Sikh Organization, both said Canada had a humanitarian responsibility to help Afghan Sikhs as persecuted religious minorities.",
        "“There was no doubt that Sikhs, being a very visible minority, would continue to be the target of attacks, World Sikh Organization president Danish Singh said in a statement.",
        "“The attempts to evacuate Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were not about favouritism but about responding to an urgent humanitarian crisis,” he said.",
        "Conservative defence critic James Bezan said in a statement Friday that Trudeau demonstrated a lack of leadership during the evacuation from Kabul because he plunged the country into a snap election.",

      content: [
        "When the anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist from the U.K. known as Tommy Robinson landed in Montreal earlier this month, he rolled his teal suitcase into the arrivals area, straight to the woman with a microphone and camera. ",
        "First, a hug. Then, the questions about travelling to Canada. ",
        "“Were you scared?” she asks, in the video posted to the social feeds of far-right website Rebel News on June 18. ",
        "“Of course,” Robinson says with a laugh. “I never thought I was getting in.",
        "“The whole time flying here I didn’t expect to get in,” he continues. “I didn’t even book a hotel!”",
        "The question of whether or not Robinson should be in the country — and what he should be doing if here — has taken on some urgency after he was arrested and then released in Calgary on an immigration offence immediately after the first event of a planned three-stop Canadian tour. ",
        "His speaking tour of Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto was his first trip to Canada. If the trip originally flew under the radar, that changed Monday when another video posted to social media showed him being handcuffed outside a hotel in Calgary, by two undercover police officers who say — before driving him away — he has an “outstanding immigration warrant.” A spokesperson for Calgary police confirmed that while they’d assisted in the arrest, it’d been conducted at the instructions of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).",
        "Everyone travelling to Canada must show they meet the requirements to enter the country, the CBSA notes, and someone can be ruled admissible for a slew of concerns, including criminal activity or human rights violations. The specific allegation Robinson faces is misrepresentation — which can include giving information that is untrue, misleading or incomplete — a spokesperson for the immigration division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada said on Thursday. ",
        "Now Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, faces a hearing, which “will determine whether or not Mr. Lennon is admissible to Canada and whether or not he will be authorized to remain or be ordered removed from Canada,” the spokesperson said in an email.",
        "Robinson is one of Britain’s most high-profile far-right figures, and one of the loudest voices in the anti-Muslim movement that sprang up in the 2000s, says Dan Collen, an extremism researcher and associate of the Canadian Institute for Far-Right Studies. “There was a lot of Islamophobia in the years post-9/11, and figures like Robinson pushed that to further limits than were necessarily socially acceptable before his time,” Collen says. ",
        "Robinson helped found the now-defunct English Defence League, an anti-Islamic protest organization, which has been banned from Facebook and Meta for breaking rules on hate speech. According to the Irish Times, he has criminal convictions related to assaulting a police office, stalking, and fraud, and has been jailed for using a false passport to enter the U.S.",
        "He is believed to have raised significant funds in donations from followers but declared bankruptcy after losing a 2021 libel case after falsely accusing a teenage Syrian refugee of violently attacking “young English girls.” ",
        "His history has caused problems entering other countries. In 2018, he was denied a visa to attend an event about Islam in the U.S. after 55 British lawmakers publicly asked he not be allowed in, citing concerns he would use the trip as an opportunity to raise funds. He was also detained in Mexico in 2022 while trying to go vacation. ",
        "Both Robinson and his hosts have blasted the arrest as an act of censorship. “Tommy’s message of freedom of speech and opposition to mass migration could be the real the reason he was arrested,” reads one story posted on Rebel News. ",
        "“I just humiliated the Canadian government on an international level,” Robinson told an online interviewer Wednesday, speaking from a beige-toned hotel room. (When getting arrested, he was a little blunter: “F—- Justin Trudeau,” he can be heard saying before the doors of the police vehicle close.) ",
        "People with violent convictions often have trouble getting into Canada, Collen says, and based on Robinson’s history and his comments on arrival, it seemed not unlikely he expected he might get arrested. ",
        "Now Robinson has said on social media that he’s been required to turn in his passport and remain in southern Alberta, which has thrown a wrench into his travel plans. Rebel News’ owner, Ezra Levant, is now arranging a lawyer. (The lawyer they are said to have hired did not respond to requests for comment.) ",
        "Despite the restrictions on his movements, Robinson seems to have kept busy. According to his feed on X, formerly Twitter, he has done an in-person interview with so-called “Freedom Convoy” leader Tamara Lich — his podcast is called SILENCED — and had a video chat with Ontario MPP Goldie Ghamari. (The Carleton MPP was kicked out of Premier Doug Ford’s caucus on Friday, after Ford called the meeting “deeply regrettable.”)",
        "The Rebel is now crowdfunding donations — by cheque or e-transfer — to help fund a lawyer for Robinson, and according to its website, had raised over half of its goal of 1,500 donations by Wednesday.",
        "(According to online archives, the Rebel has owned the domain www.tommytrial.com since at least 2019, when it was used to raise funds for Levant to go to London to cover a harassment case Robinson launched against Cambridgeshire police, arguing they’d kicked him out of a pub because of his beliefs about Islam. He eventually lost, with the judge noting he “isn’t as well known as he and his supporters may think.”) ",
        "In an interview with another online publication, he also addressed claims from some social media users that he had gotten arrested as a publicity stunt, a claim which he called “ridiculous.”",
        "“How can I purposely get myself arrested? How?” he said. “Why would I do that? I’m sat in my hotel room, I’ve got to be out now in 10 minutes, I have to change hotel rooms again, I missed my event in Edmonton, I’m missing my event in Toronto,” he added. “I don’t normally like to entertain these ridiculous allegations.”",
        "For now, he awaits his admissibility hearing, which the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada said will be scheduled in due course.",

      content: [
        "OTTAWA—Former B.C. Liberal premier Christy Clark says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has got to step down.",
        "In an interview with the Star, Clark said the message for Liberals after Monday’s Toronto-St. Paul’s byelection defeat is “unequivocal,” that Trudeau “doesn’t have the pull with voters that he once had, but more importantly, he isn’t even able to motivate some of the people in the country who are most likely to vote for his party. That’s a tough message for any leader.”",
        "Clark said she is not organizing a potential run for the job, saying it isn’t open. But she acknowledged that people are encouraging her to run if Trudeau does leave. She has not ruled that out, but said “I don’t have any of those plans ready to go.”",
        "Clark said she has no insight into whether Trudeau is truly reflecting on his political future, and she hasn’t spoken to him personally since 2017 when she left office.  ",
        "“What I do know is he’s a fighter. I do know he’s extremely competitive. And I do know that he has never lost an election or anything in his entire life. So, you know, I presume if he’s thinking about it at all, it’s a very difficult decision for him to make.”",
        "But she said the results of Monday’s vote should not be ignored by him or the party. ",
        "The midtown Toronto riding, held by the Liberal party for the past 30 years  is “bedrock for Liberal voters,” said Clark. “It’s the centre of the universe. And if people in that riding aren’t prepared to come out in the byelection and vote for him, I think it says a lot about the weakness the party is experiencing across the country.”",
        "Before and after Monday’s vote, senior Liberal and Conservative campaign organizers who spoke to the Star agreed on the factors at play in the campaign: everything from fatigue with Trudeau or skepticism about his rival, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, high housing costs, the high cost of living, concerns about a rise in antisemitism, and about how the government responded to conflict in the Middle East. Each of the main parties miscalculated how those issues would play out in the result beforehand, however. The Liberals counted on a narrow win, and Conservatives expected a narrow loss. ",
        "In the end, in a vote where turnout was relatively good, the Conservative candidate won a stunning upset, with Don Stewart gaining 42.1 per cent of the vote (well up from the party’s showing of 25 per cent in the previous general election) and Liberal Leslie Church winning 40.5 per cent (down from the party’s 2021 showing of 49 per cent). The NDP was well behind at under 11 per cent, and the Greens at under three per cent.",
        "Clark said while there may have been myriad issues at play in the byelection, “it’s impossible to separate issues from leadership.”",
        "“In my experience, if people don’t feel like the country is going in the right direction — and clearly Canada isn’t going in the right direction right now — they will blame the leader and they should. Because the leader sets the agenda. The leader is the one that gives direction to his or her cabinet. The leader is the one who sets the economic priorities or fails to do so.",
        "“Yeah, you can find exceptions to this rule, but it is almost always, all of it, is on the leader’s shoulders,” she said.",
        "Clark, a senior adviser at the law firm Bennett Jones, served as B.C. Liberal premier from 2011 to 2017, and has been a critic of Trudeau’s in recent years.",
        "Still, hers is the view of someone who once identified strongly with the federal Liberal party.",
        "“I want the Liberal party that I used to vote for to come back,” she said.",
        "Clark worked for the party in the 1990s, was national youth campaign director for Jean Chrétien’s 1993 campaign, later worked for senior cabinet minister Doug Young, and returned to B.C. in 1996, where she was elected and sat first in opposition under B.C. Liberal leader Gordon Campbell. She served in his government as deputy premier. Clark left politics in 2005, but returned to replace Campbell in 2011, and won a come-from-behind victory in the 2013 provincial election. Under her, the party narrowly won the 2017 election, with one seat shy of a majority, but did not hold onto power after the NDP and Greens struck a deal to govern.",
        "She said the federal Liberals and Conservatives have long had many points of disagreement, but in her view they used to agree on the need for economic growth, job creation and “responsible economic management.” It’s not a question that the party has moved too far to the left, she said, but it has lost its focus. ",
        "“I don’t think you can really characterize the world in terms of left and right anymore. I just don’t … really accept that paradigm. To me, governments can enable or they can impair economic growth. And that’s not really a left-right issue.”",
        "Clark blasted Trudeau for failing on three main points: on stimulating economic growth; on failing to meet international commitments on defence and managing the Canada-U.S. relationship (“Canada has really lost its lustre when it comes to meeting our international commitments and being respected internationally”); and on national unity, where she blamed Trudeau for fighting with premiers “all the time,” “setting regions against each other” and showing “favouritism.”",
        "“People out in this part of the country really feel forgotten. And there is a sense that the prime minister is playing some regions of the country off the other for his own political gain. And I don’t think anybody in the country benefits from that … It can never work for Canada. And over time, I think we all know, that’s a path that can lead to a pretty dangerous place for our country.”",
        "Senior Liberals say there is a robust reflection going on inside the party organization and the Prime Minister’s Office, and many discussions are taking place with caucus members, cabinet ministers who campaigned on the ground and senior officials. While they have not ruled out convening an early caucus meeting to discuss the way forward, no in-person meetings are scheduled at the moment. ",
        "The prime minister has not taken reporters’ questions in the three days since the byelection loss, although he has delivered brief prepared remarks this week in which he indicated he “heard” voters and his main focus remains on the interests of Canadians.",

        "With Ford considering a vote a year before the scheduled June 2026 provincial election, Abacus Data used its monthly tracking survey for the Star to ask how Ontarians would feel about heading to the polls early.",
        "“The price tag is a problem,” said Abacus president David Coletto.",
        "Indeed, when the cost of the election is factored in, 19 per cent said they would be “very angry” at a snap call while 25 per cent would be “unhappy” — a total of 44 per cent.",
        "Some 39 per cent were “neutral” while nine per cent were “happy” and eight per cent “very happy,” suggesting only a total of 17 per cent like the idea.",
        "Findings changed when respondents were asked about an early election without the $150-million cost included — only five per cent were “very angry” while 10 per cent were “unhappy” and 50 per cent “neutral” with 20 per cent “happy” and 16 per cent “very happy.”",
        "Coletto said if sticker-shocked voters come to believe an early election is “a very expensive endeavour that’s not needed,” the premier could pay a price.",
        "“It’s risky for Doug Ford to do that in this context because he’s built a brand about being frugal,” he said, noting the Tories already govern with a majority in the legislature so there is no electoral urgency.",
        "“So he would have to justify the need for an election and the expense.” ",
        "When former premier David Peterson — now chair of Torstar, the Star’s parent company — called a snap election in 1990, its $40-million price tag was a key factor in his Liberals’ surprise loss to Bob Rae’s New Democrats.",
        "Abacus surveyed 1,000 Ontarians from June 20 until Tuesday using online panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. While opt-in polls cannot be assigned a margin of error, for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have one of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",
        "The firm also asked about Ford moving “to take advantage of Justin Trudeau’s unpopularity to hold the provincial election before the federal election” expected in October 2025.",
        "Ten per cent said they would be “very angry” at that rationale while another 10 per cent said they would be “unhappy” while 50 per cent were “neutral,” 20 per cent “happy” and 16 per cent “very happy.”",
        "Overall, Ford’s Tories were at 41 per cent to 25 per cent for Bonnie Crombie’s Liberals, 22 per cent for Marit Stiles’s New Democrats and eight per cent for Mike Schreiner’s Greens.",
        "While that’s largely unchanged from last month’s poll, the PC government’s disapproval rating jumped from 40 per cent in May to 45 per cent in June with its approval rating falling from 37 per cent to 34 per cent.",
        "“Something has happened in the last month that may have turned off some people, because that’s a change outside the margin of error,” said Coletto.",
        "On May 24, Ford announced the government would pay The Beer Store $225 million to expedite the liberalization of beer, wine and premixed cocktail sales in convenience stores, supermarkets and big-box outlets by Halloween.",
        "The premier — whose original plan was for that to be completed by Dec. 31, 2025 — wants to be seen keeping a major 2018 campaign promise in case he opts for an election early next year.",
        "But Crombie’s Liberals insist the tab for speeding up the changes could be three or four times more than $225 million, which is why she has dubbed the rushed scheme “a billion-dollar booze boondoggle.”",
        "Asked for their impressions of the four party leaders, 35 per cent had a positive impression of Ford while 45 per cent had a negative impression with 18 per cent neutral and two per cent didn’t know enough to say.",
        "That’s a net impression rating for the premier of minus 10 per cent.",
        "Crombie was 28 per cent positive, 30 per cent negative, 26 per cent neutral and 15 per cent unsure for a minus two per cent net rating.",
        "Stiles had a 28 per cent positive, 24 per cent negative, 30 per cent neutral and 18 per cent unsure for a net rating of plus four per cent.",

        "Almost all of the exhibition space at the Ontario Science Centre is unaffected by structural concerns raised by engineers and the province did not have to take such drastic action by shutting down the whole building, says an architect from the firm that designed it.",
        "Brian Rudy, a partner and principal architect at Moriyama Teshima, said immediate repairs could be done in the coming months, and the rest phased in over the next decade, all while keeping the building open to the public. ",
        "“The vast majority of exhibition spaces are completely safe,” he told reporters at Queen’s Park on Friday, and of the panels that do need to be replaced, “it’s a drop in the bucket, probably less than one per cent. And again, those panels can be very easily repaired, cordoned off where they are an issue and the public can be completely protected.”",
        "Closing the building “was not a necessity, but a choice,” he added.",
        "The science centre was shuttered last Friday in a move that took many by surprise, after engineers deemed parts of the roof to be at risk of collapsing because of the use of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, also known as RAAC.",
        "The Ministry of Infrastructure said parts of the building only had a few months before they would be structurally unsound, and that the centre would be closed to the public immediately, giving staff time to clear out the exhibits.",
        "In the United Kingdom, more than 100 schools had to be shut down last fall after similar issues with RAAC were discovered.",
        "The Rimkus Consulting Group’s engineering report on the science centre estimated a cost of $22 million to $40 million and two to five years to repair the existing science centre buildings on Don Mills Road, and said fixes in “high risk” locations could cost as little as $522,500.",
        "That would have allowed the centre to remain at least partially operational before an already scheduled move to the Ontario Place property in 2028 that’s part of a controversial renewal that includes a privately owned spa.",
        "The government is now looking to temporarily relocate the science centre.",
        "The 52-page report, now under peer review by another engineering firm, said only one of the RAAC panels is classified as “critical risk,” while five per cent were “high risk,” two per cent “medium risk” and 92 per cent “low risk.”",
        "But the firm emphasized that was a preliminary assessment, warning that “the compromised panels have been functioning with a reduced factor of safety, when compared to the original design intent.”",
        "“A significant snow or rain loading occurrence could exceed the reduced load carrying capacity of the distressed panels, placing them at an increased risk of sudden collapse,” the report said.",
        "A senior government official told the Star the government had to act because “any risk of collapse is too much risk.”",
        "Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma has said “we had every intention on keeping the science centre open until the new science centre is built, but I cannot ignore the health and safety warning ... I have an obligation to protect the public.”",
        "NDP Leader Marit Stiles said Thursday it would cost less to repair the existing site instead of shutting it down, relocating it temporarily and moving it to the Ontario Place redevelopment on the waterfront.",
        "On Friday, Liberal MPP Adil Shamji, whose Don Valley East riding includes the science centre, said “the building is safe ... it should remain open (and) repairs can and should responsibly be done and that the province has the means to do it.”",
        "Shamji said the government is “taking details that are technically accurate, but coming forward with the completely flawed interpretation of those technically accurate details.”",
        "Rudy said the most pressing repairs “could probably be done in three to six months” and the rest spread out over a years-long schedule.",
        "He said his firm designed the Toronto Reference Library “and it has been fully occupied for the entirety of its life ... and we’ve done a complete rejig of that building — every square inch of it has been rebuilt and reconstructed. And it’s never closed its doors to the public. We do it by co-ordinating all areas, fixing them and opening them up.”",
        "“As an architect and as part of the team of professionals that build cities, we don’t build cities by tearing down our historic structures,” Rudy said.",
        "”... This is such an amazing building that we all remember from our childhood, and we all remember taking our children through. How can we allow this building to be desecrated in this way and maybe potentially torn down? It’s just unthinkable.”",
